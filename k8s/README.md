# Kubernetes manifests

TODO: some bad stuff happens when you do many operations that work on same deployment in a short time, seems to be under control with normal usage

By default monitor-page namespace is used.
Currently there is one user limit for deployment (just naming stuff).
Postgres DB set up requires `postgres-operator`.

These secrets have to be manually provided:
* `secret-registry` that contains `dockerconfigjson` data required to access private Docker registry.
* `secret-sendgrid` that provides `api-key` entry containing, well... API key to sendgrid (it's used by mail senders)
* `secret-jwt`      that provides `jwt-secret` entry containing value that's a base for JWT
